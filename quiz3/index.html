  <p>&quot;Cans of peanuts have a stated net weight of 500g.  However, due to variation in the canning process, the actual net weight has an approximate normal distribution with a mean of 505g and a standard deviation of 10g.

  <p>We know that the sample means follow a t-distribution with \(df = 100 - 1 = 99\). Hence, the t-stat corresponding to a 98% confidence interval is given by \(t^{*} = 2.3646\). From the data, we know that the margin-of-error is given by moe = (14.9489 - 14.2511)/2, which equals 0.3489. </p>

<p>We know that moe = tstar x se. Hence se = moe/tstar, which gives us se = 0.1476.</p>

<p>NOTE: The question asks you for the <strong>standard deviation of the sample mean</strong>, which is the standard error. Many of you assumed that the question asked for the standard deviation of the <strong>sample</strong> and hence divided your answer by the square root of the sample size. </p>

  <p>A credit manager has chosen a sample of size 2,164 to estimate the mean balance of credit accounts to within \$0.50.  A pilot study of 50 accounts had a mean of \$1,219 and a variance of 100.  The level of confidence of the interval is:</p>

  <p>From the pilot study, we get \(\bar{x} = 1219\) and \(s = 10\). Hence,  the standard error of the sample mean, for a sample of size 2164 is given by \(s/\sqrt{2164} = 0.215\). Since, we know that \(moe = t^{*} \times se\), equals 0.50, we can solve for \(t^{*} = 0.50/0.215 = 2.326\). The corresponding confidence level can hence be found to be 98%</p>

  <p>A recent Gallup Poll dealt with the proportion of Canadians who favoured the various Prime Ministers. It found that only Pierre Trudeau did quite well, of all Prime Ministers in recent memory, and that the proportion favouring Brian Mulroney is quite low.  A newspaper article included the following statement:  “Results are based on 1,037 interviews with Canadian adults conducted July 6 - 9, 2006.  Gallup says a sample this size is accurate within 4 percentage points, 19 in 20 times”.  In fact, the precision of their estimate of the population proportion was not 4 percentage points.  Find the closest precision below, when estimating the population proportion at 50%.</p>

<li>95% of all values of the population lie in the interval.</li>
<li>If we were to repeat our survey many times, then about 95% of all the confidence intervals will contain the value \$45,000.</li>

  <p>Since we reject the NULL at 2% significance level, the standardized test statistic must be less than -2.1099 (calculated using t-distribution with df = 49 and alpha = 0.02).</p>

<p>We know that t = (xbar2 - xbar1)/se, where the se is given by \(\sqrt(10^{2}/50 + 11^{2}/75)\) = 1.9009. Since t must be less than -2.1099, we get that xbar2 - xbar1 must be less than 1.9009 x -2.1099, which corresponds to answer (B).</p>

  <p>&quot;A test of hypothesis is performed to determine whether the proportion of Montrealers (population 1) who want the decriminalization of marijuana is greater than the proportion of Torontonians (population 2) who want decriminalization of marijuana.  A random sample of 120 Montrealers had 90 who favor while a random sample 150 Torontonians also had 90 who favor.  The level of significance of the test is 1%.  Then the classical action limit for the appropriate test of hypothesis is:&quot;</p>

  <p>We can compute the pooled proportion as (90 + 90)/(120 + 150), which gives us p = 0.6667. The standard error is given by sqrt(0.667 * (1 - 0.667)*(1/150 + 1/200)), which gives us 0.0577.</p>

<p>The critical test statistic corresponding to 1% is given by -2.3263. Hence, the classical action limit is given by -2.3263 x 0.0577, which gives us -0.1343</p>

  <p>&quot;A company produces pesticides.  A new product DieBug (Population 1) is to be compared with the product currently in use, Blastem (Population 2).  Two rooms of equal size are sprayed with the same amount of spray, room #1 with DieBug and room #2 with Blastem.  Three hundred insects are released into room #1 and four hundred in room #2.  After 30 minutes the number of dead insects are is counted.  195 dead insects were found in room #1 and 275 dead insects were found in room #2.  What is the standard deviation of p-bar1 minus p-bar2?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;A recent drop in the value of the Canadian dollar versus foreign currencies is expected to increase the value of Canadian exports.  A comparison of the current year&#39;s (Population 2) versus last year&#39;s (Population 1) shipments (in thousands of dollars) for each of six Canadian exporters is given as follows: (4.77, 4.34), (5.16, 5.89), (2.73, 2.52), (4.39, 3.91), (5.25, 4.99), (3.80, 3.24).  It is assumed that the population of differences between the current year’s and last year&#39;s shipments is approximately normal.  Then, a 95% confidence interval estimate for the mean difference is:&quot;</p>

  <p>A company with two plants producing the same product, but with two slightly different manufacturing processes, conducted a sample study at each of the two plants with the following results: The sample statistics from the first group are: n = 40, x-bar = 18, s = 4.2. The sample statistics from the second group are: n = 50, x-bar = 20, s = 4.  In testing the hypothesis that the mean time to produce the product is the same at both plants, what is the p-value of the test?</p>
