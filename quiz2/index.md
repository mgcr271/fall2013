  margin: auto auto;
}
</style>

In order to determine if smoking causes cancer, researchers surveyed a large sample of adults.  For each adult, they recorded whether the person had smoked regularly at any period in their life and whether the person had cancer.  They then compared the proportion of cancer cases in those who had smoked regularly at some time in their life with the proportion of cases in those who had never smoked regularly at any point in their life.  The researchers found a higher proportion of cancer cases among those who had smoked regularly than among those who had never smoked regularly. This is:

1. _an observational study._
2. a double blind experiment.
3. a block design.
4. an experiment, but not a double blind experiment.

*** .explanation

It is an `observational study` since the researchers did not control the explanatory variable: smoker.

## Question 1B

In order to assess the effects of exercise on reducing cholesterol, a researcher sampled 50 people from a local gym who exercised regularly and 50 people from the surrounding community who did not exercise regularly.  They each reported to a clinic to have their cholesterol measured.  The subjects were unaware of the purpose of the study, and the technician measuring the cholesterol was not aware of whether subjects exercised regularly or not.  This is:

  
1. _an observational study._
2. an experiment, but not a double-blind experiment.
3. a double-blind experiment.
4. a matched pairs experiment.

*** .explanation

It is an `observational study` since the researchers did not control how people were assigned to the two treatments: exercise regularly vs. not exercise regularly.

## Question 1C

In order to investigate whether women are more likely than men to prefer Democratic candidates, a political scientist selects a large sample of registered voters, both men and women.  She asks every voter whether they voted for the Republican or the Democratic candidate in the last election.  This is:

1. a multistage sample.
2. a double blind experiment.
3. a block design.
4. _an observational study._

## Question 2A

It is known that in the United States, well-educated people are less likely to smoke. But what about other nations, where there may be different cultures and/or attitudes towards smoking? In a 1998 study of the relationship between education and smoking in France, a random sample of 334 French men was classified according to their education level (elementary, high-school, or university) and their smoking habits (smoker or non-smoker).


1. This study is an experiment, since each subject was classified into one of the six possible combinations of education level and smoking habits.
2. _This study is an observational study, since researchers did not assign the men to be smokers or non-smokers, or to one of the education levels._
3. This study is an experiment, since it was based on a random sample.
4. This study is a combination of both an experiment and an observational study.

## Question 2B

In an experiment to see if aspirin reduces the chance of having a heart attack, a placebo is:

1. the place where the subjects go when they have a heart attack.
2. the sampling method.
3. the randomization procedure
4. a procedure for deciding who gets the aspirin treatment.  
5. _a dummy pill that looks like aspirin but has no active ingredients._

## Question 2C

For their 1992 study “The Effect of Country Music on Suicide” (published in Social Forces, vol. 71, p. 211), researchers Stack and Gundlach investigated various American communities, recording the number of minutes of daily radio airtime devoted to country songs and the suicide rate. They found a moderately strong positive correlation. In their paper, the researchers explain the results by saying that “…the themes found in country music foster a suicidal mood ...” (emphasis added).

<!-- A news headline (The Independent [London], October 1, 2004, p. 15) about the research echoed these sentiments when it said, “Strange But True: Country Music Saps Will to Live.” The research is even cited on various suicide-prevention websites, some with headings such as “Country Music Increases Suicide Risk.” -->

1. Based on this study, can we have confidence in causality between country music and suicide?
2. Yes, causality is indicated by the moderately strong correlation.	
3. Yes, as long as the communities were sampled randomly, and the number of communities (the sample size) was sufficiently large.
4. _No, because the lack of assignment of communities to different levels of country music listening means there is a possibility of lurking variables._
5. Yes, since different communities listened to different levels of country music, meaningful experimental comparisons can be made.

## Question 3A

A telemarketer is calling a randomly chosen phone number. Consider the events A = Person answering is a Male, B = Person answering is a Female. The events A and B are (select ALL that apply)
  
1. independent
2. _disjoint_
3. none of these
4. _complements_
5. uniform.

*** .explanation

If the person answering the phone is a male (A), then it cannot be a female (B). Hence A and B are __disjoint__. They are also __complements__ since the probabilities of the two events add up to 1.

--- &checkbox

## Question 3B

Two people are selected simultaneously and at random from a very large population. Consider the events: A = Person 1 is a Female, B = Person 2 is a Male. The events A and B are (select ALL that apply)

  
1. complements
2. disjoint
3. _independent_
4. none of these
5. uniform.

*** .explanation

As the population is large, the two events are __independent__. They are NOT __disjoint__ as it is possible for both A and B to happen. The other choices rule themselves out in a similar way.

--- &checkbox

## Question 3C

A stack of four cards contains two red cards and two black cards.  I select two cards, one at a time, and do not replace the first card selected before selecting the second card.  Consider the events: A = the first card selected is red B = the second card selected is red. The events A and B are (select ALL that apply)

1. complements
2. disjoint
3. independent
4. _none of these_
5. uniform.

*** .explanation

Both A and B can happen simultaneously. Moreover, A affects B, since picking a red card on the first attempt, does change the chances of picking a red card in the second. Hence A and B are neither __disjoint__ NOR __independent__. They are clearly not __complements__ and nor are they __uniform__.

## Question 4A

In order to obtain a sample of undergraduate students in the United States, a simple random sample of 10 states is selected. From each of the selected states, 10 colleges or universities are chosen at random. Finally, from each of these 100 colleges or universities, a simple random sample of 20 undergraduate students is selected. Thus, the final sample consists of 2,000 undergraduates.

This is an example of:

1. stratified sampling
2. simple random sampling
3. _multistage sampling_
4. cluster sampling

*** .explanation

This is `multistage sampling` since it employs multiple stages of sampling in its design. 

--- .smaller &radio

## Question 4B

Which of the following are examples of stratified sampling? Select ALL that apply.

1. A sample of 351 people called a radio show to express their opinions about the verdict in the Michael Jackson trial.
2. _A health educator wanted to study the sleeping habits of the undergraduate students in her university. For her study, the researcher chose a simple random sample of size 150 from each of the classes (150 freshmen, 150 sophomores, 150 juniors, and 150 seniors), for a total of 600 sampled students._
3. A poll asked a random sample of 1,112 adults whether they believe that the use of marijuana for medical reasons should be legalized.
4. The human resources department of a large bank wanted to assess the job satisfaction of the bank's workers. The department chose four of the bank's branches at random, and used all of the workers in those four branches as the subjects for the study.
5. In order to assess students' satisfaction with the food establishment on campus, the first 50 students that come out of the student center were interviewed.

*** .explanation

The sampling design for each example is shown below.

1. Voluntary Sampling (people just call in!)
2. Stratified Sampling (break into classes, SRS from each class)
3. Simple Random Sample
4. Cluster Sampling (break into clusters, select ALL from some clusters)
5. Convenience Sample (first 50 students coming out were interviewed)

## Question 5

According to the information that comes with a certain prescription drug, when taking this drug, there is a 20% chance of experiencing nausea (N) and a 50% chance of experiencing decreased sexual drive (D). The information also states that there is a 15% chance of experiencing both side effects.

We are essentially given

P(N) = 0.20
P(D) = 0.50
P(N and D) = 0.15

--- &radio

## Question 5A

What is the probability of experiencing neither of the side effects?


1. 0.10
2. 0.70
3. 0.85
4. 0.40
5. _0.45_

*** .explanation

The probability of experiencing neither side effects is one minus the probablity of experiencing at least one. So, we have p = 1 - [P(N) + P(D) - P(N and D)], which gives us 0.45

--- &radio

## Question 5B

What is the probability of experiencing exactly one of the two side effects?

1. 0.10
2. _0.40_
3. 0.55
4. 0.70
5. 0.85

*** .explanation

The probability of experiencing exactly one of the side effects is the probability of at least one of the side effects occuring minus the probability of both occuring. So we have P(N or D) - P(N and D), which gives us [P(N) + P(D) - P(N and D)] - P(N and D), which simplifies to 0.4

--- &radio

## Question 5C

What is the probability of experiencing nausea or a decrease in sexual drive?

1. _0.55_
2. 0.85
3. 0.70
4. 0.10
5. 0.40

*** .explanation

The probability of N or D is given by P(N) + P(D) - P(N and D), which gives us 0.55

--- &radio

## Question 6A

I flip a fair coin twice and count the number of heads.  Which of the following is the correct sample space for this probability model?  (Use H to represent getting a head and T to represent getting a tail.)
	
1. _{HH, HT, TH, TT}_
2. {H, T}
3. {HH, TT}
4. {HH, HT, TT}

--- &radio

## Question 6B

I select two cards from a deck of 52 cards and observe the color of each (26 cards in the deck are red and 26 are black).  Which of the following is the most appropriate sample space S for the possible outcomes?
 	
1. S = {0, 1, 2}.
2. S = {red, black}.
3. _S = {(red, red), (red, black), (black, red), (black, black)}, where, for example, (red, red) stands for the event "the first card is red and the second card is red."_
4. All of these

*** .explanation

We select two cards from the deck and observe the color of the cards. So each outcome consists or a set of two colors chosen from __red__ and __black__. The only choice that consists of all such outcomes is the third one.

## Question 7

A study of human development showed two types of movies to groups of children.  Crackers were available in a bowl, and the investigators compared the number of crackers eaten by children watching the different kinds of movies.  One kind of movie was shown at 8 AM (right after the children had breakfast) and another at 11 AM (right before the children had lunch).  It was found that during the movie shown at 11 AM, more crackers were eaten than during the movie shown at 8 AM.  The investigators concluded that the different types of movies had an effect on appetite. 

--- &radio

## Question 7A

The results cannot be trusted because:

1. _the time the movie was shown is a confounding variable._
2. the investigators should have used several bowls, with crackers randomly placed in each.
3. the investigators were biased.  They knew beforehand what they hoped the study would show.
4. the study was not double-blind.  Neither the investigators nor the children should have been aware of which movie was being shown.

*** .explanation

It is not surprising that children ate more crackers at the movie shown before lunch than at the movie shown after breakfast. Hence, it was the timing of the movie that influenced this behavior and not the type of movie itself. Thus, time of the movie is a confounding variable.

--- &radio

## Question 7B


The response variable in this experiment is:

1. the time the movie was shown.
2. _the number of crackers eaten._
3. the bowls.
4. the different kinds of movies.

--- &radio

## Question 7C ##

The treatment in this experiment is:

1. the bowls.
2. _the different kinds of movies._
3. the time the movie was shown.
4. the number of crackers eaten.

## Question 8A

Suppose that A and B are two independent events with P(A) = 0.5 and P(B) = 0.2.  P(A and Not B) is:

1. 0.10.
2. 0.30.
3. _0.40_
4. 0.60.

*** .explanation

P(A and not B) = P(A) - P(A and B), which gives us 0.5 - (0.5 * 0.2), which simplifies to 0.4

--- &radio

## Question 8B

Suppose that A and B are two independent events with P(A) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.3.  P(A or  B) is:

1. 0.09
2. _0.51_
3. 0.52
4. 0.60

*** .explanation

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), which gives us 0.3 + 0.3 - 0.3 * 0.3. On simplifying, we get 0.51

--- &radio

## Question 8C

In a certain town 60% of the households own mutual funds, 40% own individual stocks, and 20% own both mutual funds and individual stocks. The proportion of households that own neither mutual funds nor individual stocks is:

1. _20%_
2. 30%
3. 40%
4. 50%.

*** .explanation

P(Not M and Not S) = 1 - P(M or S) = 1 - [P(M) + P(S) - P(M and S)]. Plugging in values, we get 1 - (0.60 + 0.40 - 0.20) = 0.2

--- &radio

## Question 8D

In a certain town 60% of the households own mutual funds, 40% own individual stocks, and 20% own both mutual funds and individual stocks. The proportion of households that own mutual funds but not individual stocks is:

1. 20%
2. 30%
3. _40%_
4. 50%

*** .explanation

P(M but not S) = P(M) - P(M and S) which gives us 0.6 - 0.2 = 0.4

--- &radio

## Question 9

Let A and B be two disjoint events such that P(A) = 0.20 and P(B) = 0.60. What is P(A and B)


1. 0.80
2. 0.68
3. 0.12	
4. None of these
5. _0_

*** .explanation

By definition, two disjoint events cannot happen simultaneously and hence P(A and B) = 0

## Question 10

The heights of South African men are normally distributed with a mean of 69 inches and a standard deviation of 4 inches. Answer the next two questions based on this.

--- &radio

## Question 10A

If a random sample of three South African men were selected at random, what is the probability that all three of their heights are greater than 72 inches?

1. 0.2266.
2. _0.0116_
3. 0.0968.
4. 0.0009.

*** .explanation

Let us denote the heights of the three men as X1, X2 and X3. We want the probability that X1 > 72, X2 > 72 and X3 > 72. We can calculate P(X1 > 72) using the fact that it is normally distributed with mean 72 inches and standard deviation 4. So the probability that all three heights are greater than 72 is just P(X1 > 72) * P(X2 > 72) * P(X3 > 72), which equals P(X1 > 72)^3.


--- &radio

## Question 10B

If a random sample of three South African men were selected at random, what is the probability that the sample mean height is greater than 72 inches?

1. 0.2266
2. 0.1299
3. _0.0968_
4. 0.0122.

*** .explanation

Here we are asked about the probability of the sample mean being greater than 72 inches. We know that the sample mean follows a normal distribution with mean 72 and standard deviation 4/sqrt(3). We can use that to calculate P(Xbar > 72).

--- &radio

## Question 10C

What is the probability that a randomly selected South African man is taller than 72 inches?

1. 0.7500.
2. 0.7734.
3. 0.2500.
4. _0.2266_

*** .explanation

Let us denote the height of the man as X1. We want the probability that X1 > 72. We can calculate P(X1 > 72) using the fact that it is normally distributed with mean 72 inches and standard deviation 4.

## Question 11

A particular electronic component is produced at two plants for an electronics manufacturer. Plant A produces 60% of the components used and the remainder are produced by plant B. The proportion of defective components produced at plant A is 1% and the proportion of defective components produced at plant B is 2%. Answer the next two questions based on this.

--- &radio

## Question 11A

If a component received by the manufacturer is not defective, the probability that it was produced at plant A is:

1. _0.602_
2. 0.622
3. 0.684
4. 0.713

*** .explanation

P(A) = 60%, P(B) = 40%, P(D | A) = 1% and P(D | B) = 2%.

P(A | ND) = P(ND | A)*P(A)/[P(ND | A) * P(A) + P(ND | B) * P(B)]. Plugging in values, we get

P(A | ND) = (1 - 0.01) * 0.60/[(1 - 0.01) * 0.60 + (1 - 0.02) * 0.40], which gives us 0.6024


--- &radio

## Question 11C

The proportion of non-defective components that the electronics manufacturer receives from these two plants is:

1. 0.982.
2. 0.984.
